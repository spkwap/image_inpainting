# Image Inpainting Project

This project implements an image inpainting application using a pretrained neural network model. Users can upload an image, draw a mask to indicate the area they want to inpaint, and the application will recreate the image without the masked area.

## Features

- Upload images
- Draw masks on images
- Repaint images using a neural network model
